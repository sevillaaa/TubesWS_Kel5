        He takes you out and he takes you up <br>
        'Cause he can show you so much <br>
        I go to bed and tomorrow again <br>
        There's a lot of work to be done <br>
        He gives you gold and he will promise you <br>
        The whole world will be yours <br>
        I just can't tell you I love you so <br>
        Even though my odds are low <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
        That you will love me anyway <br>
        The dirty games in the name of jokes <br>
        This is the world he knows <br>
        Watching the stars satisfies my soul <br>
        Thinking of him makes me feel so cold <br>
        The fancy cars and the restaurants <br>
        You're just so fond of the man <br>
        Sometimes I wonder if you are blind <br>
        Can't you see he's got dirt on his mind <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
        That you will love me anyway (anyway) <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
        That you will love me anyway <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
        That you will love me anyway (anyway) <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
        That you will love me anyway <br>
        I'm not an actor, I'm not a star <br>
        And I don't even have my own car <br>
        But I'm hoping so much you'll stay <br>
