        <muzzy:lyrics xml:space="preserve">
            Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
            I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better
            It's not a walk in the park to love each other
            But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

            'Cause after all this time
            I'm still into you

            I should be over all the butterflies
            But I'm into you (I'm into you)
            And, baby, even on our worst nights
            I'm into you (I'm into you)
            Let 'em wonder how we got this far
            'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
            Yeah, after all this time
            I'm still into you

            Recount the night that I first met your mother
            And on the drive back to my house, I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
            You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
            And to your favorite song, we sang along to the start of forever
            
            I should be over all the butterflies
            But I'm into you (I'm into you)
            And, baby, even on our worst nights
            I'm into you (I'm into you)
            Let 'em wonder how we got this far
            'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
            Yeah, after all this time
            I'm still into you

            Some things just, some things just make sense
            And one of those is you and I (Hey)
            Some things just, some things just make sense
            And even after all this time (Hey)
            I'm into you
            Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you

            I should be over all the butterflies
            But I'm into you (I'm into you)
            And, baby, even on our worst nights
            I'm into you (I'm into you)
            Let 'em wonder how we got this far
            'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
            Yeah, after all this time
            I'm still into you
            I'm still into you
            I'm still into you

            When she was just a girl, she expected the world
            But it flew away from her reach
            So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
            Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
            Every time she closed her 
            
            When she was just a girl, she expected the world
            But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
            Life goes on, it gets so heavy
            The wheel breaks the butterfly, every tear a waterfall
            In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
            In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly
            
            And dream of para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise

            She'd dream of para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise

            La-la-la-la-la-la-la
            La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
            And so lying underneath those stormy skies
            She'd say, "oh
            I know the sun must set to rise"

            This could be para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise

            This could be para-para-paradise
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

            This could be para-para-paradise
            Para-para-
            
            This could be para-para-paradise
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

            This could be para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise

            This could be para-para-paradise
            (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

            It's beautiful, it's bittersweet, you're like a broken home to me
            I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
            I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
            I make up lies inside my head, like, "One day, you'll come back to me"

            Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
            I'm just depressed that you're gone
            Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

            Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
            She's naked in my bed
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
            I wouldn't take 'em back
            I'm in love with the past
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

            Nah-nah-nah, in my head
            Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
            Nah-nah-nah (ay)
            Making beautiful mistakes

            It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me (yeah, yeah)
            I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
            I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
            I make these lies inside my head, feel like they're my reality

            Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
            I'm just depressed that you're gone
            Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

            Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
            She's naked in my bed
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
            I wouldn't take 'em back
            I'm in love with the past
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

            Nah-nah-nah, in my head
            Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
            Nah-nah-nah (yeah, yeah)
            Making beautiful mistakes

            You did me wrong 'cause I let you
            Usually, I like my situations beneficial
            Doing something different, got me looking stupid (damn)
            The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (yeah)
            Prove it, if you made a promise, then keep it (keep it)
            Why you wanna lie, and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)

            But really, I was doing just fine without ya
            Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (ah)
            Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
            Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
            How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
            You running outta chances, and this time I mean it (ah)

            Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (bed)
            Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (hair)
            Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
            Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (sad)
            I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
            Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
            And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
            You're toxic

            Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
            She's naked in my bed
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
            I wouldn't take 'em back
            I'm in love with the past
            And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

            Nah-nah-nah, in my head
            Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
            Nah-nah-nah (yeah, yeah, oh)
            Making beautiful mistakes

            Nah-nah-nah, in my head
            Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
            Nah-nah-nah (ay, beautiful)
            Making beautiful mistakes

            Nah-nah-nah
            Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
            Nah-nah-nah

            Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
            Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
            Everything she never had, she's showin' off
            Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
            She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
            Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

            (Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
            (Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            (Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
            (Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
            (Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
            (Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

            (Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
            (Ooh) It will never change me and you

            Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head
            He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
            Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
            Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
            She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
            Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

            (Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
            (Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
            (Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

            Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
            Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
            Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost

            Ow! Cha! Shoo-ca-choo-ca!

            As he came into the window
            Was a sound of a crescendo
            He came into her apartment
            He left the bloodstains on the carpet
            She ran underneath the table
            He could see she was unable
            So she ran into the bedroom
            She was struck down, it was her doom

            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

            Annie, are you okay?
            Will you tell us that you're okay?
            There's a sound at the window
            Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
            He came into your apartment
            Left the bloodstains on the carpet
            And then you ran into the bedroom
            You were struck down
            It was your doom

            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

            You've been hit by—
            You've been hit by—
            A smooth criminal (Ow!)

            So they came in to the out way
            It was Sunday, what a black day
            Every time I tried to find him
            There were no clues, they’re behind him
            And they end up never knowing
            Who’s the suspect or what to expect
            Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
            Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
            Annie, are you okay?
            So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

            Annie, are you okay?
            Will you tell us that you're okay?
            There's a sound at the window
            Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
            He came into your apartment
            Left the bloodstains on the carpet
            And then you ran into the bedroom
            You were struck down
            It was your doom

            Are you okay, Annie?

            You've been hit by—
            You've been struck by—
            A smooth criminal

            Choo-cha, choo-cha
            Ow!
            Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

            Ow! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Ow!

            Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
            Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
            It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
            Why you walk out my life?

            Go ahead and park after dark
            Fallen star, I'm your one call away
            Motel halls, neon walls
            When night falls, I am your escape

            When you lay alone, I ache
            Something I wanted to feel

            If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
            Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
            'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
            But an angel ain't what I need

            Not anyone, you're the one
            More than fun, you're the sanctuary
            'Cause what you want is what I want
            Sincerity

            Souls that dream alone lie awake
            I’ll give you somethin’ so real

            'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
            But an angel ain't what I need

            Hold me oh so close
            'Cause you never know
            Just how long our lives will be

        <muzzy:lyrics xml:space="preserve">
            You're way too beautiful, girl
            That's why it'll never work
            You have me suicidal, suicidal
            When you say it's over
            Damn, all these beautiful girls
            They only wanna do you dirt
            They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
            When they say it's over

            See, it started at the park, used to chill after dark
            Oh, when you took my heart, that's when we fell apart
            'Cause we both thought that love last forever (Last forever)
            They say we're too young to get ourselves sprung
            Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
            And they also said that we couldn't last together (Last together)

            See, it's very defined, you're one of a kind
            But you mash up my mind, you haffi get declined
            Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

            You're way too beautiful, girl
            That's why it'll never work
            You have me suicidal, suicidal
            When you say it's over
            Damn, all these beautiful girls
            They only wanna do you dirt
            They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
            When they say it's over

            It was back in '99, watchin' movies all the time
            Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
            And I never thought that we was gonna see each other (See each other)
            And then I came out, mami moved me down south
            Oh, I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
            It came out to be that she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

            See, it's very defined, you're one of a kind
            But you mash up my mind, you haffi get declined
            Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

            You're way too beautiful, girl
            That's why it'll never work
            You have me suicidal, suicidal
            When you say it's over
            Damn, all these beautiful girls
            They only wanna do you dirt
            They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
            When they say it's over

            Now we're fussin', and now we're fighting
            Please tell me why I'm feelin' slighted
            And I don't know how to make it better (Make it better)
            You're dating other guys, you're telling me lies
            Oh, I can't believe what I'm seein' with my eyes
            I'm losin' my mind and I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

            You're way too beautiful, girl
            That's why it'll never work
            You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal

            You prolly think that you are better now, better now
            You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
            You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
            Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
            You know I say that I am better now, better now
            I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
            You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
            Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
            Oh-oh

            I did not believe that it would end, no
            Everything came second to the Benzo
            You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
            You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
            Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
            We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
            Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
            Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
            And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
            With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
            Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
            But I can't get this shit outta my head

            You prolly think that you are better now, better now
            You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
            You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

            Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
            Oh-oh

            I seen you with your other dude
            He seemed like he was pretty cool
            I was so broken over you
            Life, it goes on, what can you do?
            I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
            Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
            Because no matter how my life has changed
            I keep on looking back on better days

            You prolly think that you are better now, better now
            You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
            You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
            Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

            I promise
            I swear to you, I'll be okay
            You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

            He takes you out and he takes you up
            'Cause he can show you so much
            I go to bed and tomorrow again
            There's a lot of work to be done

            He gives you gold and he'll promise you
            The whole world will be yours
            I just can tell you I love you so
            Even though my odds are low

            I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
            And I don't even have my own car
            But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
            That you will love me anyway

            The dirty games and the neon shows
            This is the world he knows
            Watching the stars satisfies my soul
            Thinking of him makes me feel so cold

            The fancy cars and the restaurants
            You're just so fond of the man
            Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
            Can't you see he's got dirt on his mind

            I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
            And I don't even have my own car
            But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
            That you will love me anyway

            Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
            I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
            She told me in the mornin' she don't feel the same about us in her bones
            It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone

            And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
            The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
            The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
            With nothing in between

            The story of my life, I take her home
            I drive all night to keep her warm
            And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
            The story of my life, I give her hope
            I spend her love until she's broke inside
            The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

            Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
            Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
            I know that in the mornin', I'll see us in the light up on the hill
            Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

            And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
            The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)
            The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)
            With nothing in between

            The story of my life, I take her home
            I drive all night to keep her warm
            And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
            The story of my life, I give her hope
            I spend her love until she's broke inside
            The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

            And I've been waiting for this time to come around
            But, baby, running after you is like chasin' the clouds

            The story of my life, I take her home
            I drive all night to keep her warm
            And time is frozen

            The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)
            I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)
            The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

            The story of my life
            The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

        <muzzy:lyrics xml:space="preserve">
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

            Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
            You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
            Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
            You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

            Killing me slow, out the window
            I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
            What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

            And it's new, the shape of your body
            It's blue, the feeling I've got
            And it's ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
            No rules in breakable heaven
            But ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer with you

            Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
            I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
            We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
            We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

            So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
            I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
            And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

            It's new, the shape of your body
            It's blue, the feeling I've got
            And it's ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
            No rules in breakable heaven
            But ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer with you

            I'm drunk in the back of the car
            And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
            Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
            I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
            And I snuck in through the garden gate
            Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
            And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
            I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
            He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

            It's new, the shape of your body
            It's blue, the feeling I've got
            And it's ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
            No rules in breakable heaven
            But ooh, woah-oh
            It's a cruel summer with you

            I'm drunk in the back of the car
            And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
            Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
            I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
            And I snuck in through the garden gate
            Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
            And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
            I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
