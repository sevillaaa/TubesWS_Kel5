        <rdfs:label>Still Into You</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:lyrics>Can't count the years on one hand
                    That we've been together
                    I need the other one to hold you
                    Make you feel, make you feel better

                    It's not a walk in the park
                    To love each other
                    But when our fingers interlock,
                    Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
                    'Cause after all this time I'm still into you

                    I should be over all the butterflies
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)
                    And baby even on our worst nights
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)

                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far
                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
                    Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

                    Recount the night that
                    I first met your mother
                    And on the drive back to my house
                    I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

                    You felt the weight of the world
                    Fall off your shoulder
                    And to your favorite song
                    We sang along to the start of forever
                    And after all this time I'm still into you

                    I should be over all the butterflies
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)
                    And baby even on our worst nights
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)
                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far
                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
                    Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

                    Well, some things just, some things just make sense
                    And one of those is you and I (Hey)
                    Some things just, some things just make sense
                    And even after all this time (Hey)

                    I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by
                    That I'm not into you

                    I should be over all the butterflies
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)
                    And baby even on our worst nights
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)
                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far

                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
                    Yeah, after all this time
                    I'm still into you
                    I'm still into you
                    I'm still into you

        <muzzy:lyrics>Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
                    Baby, I'm dying for another taste

                    And every night my mind is running around her
                    Thunder's getting louder and louder

                    Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
                    I can't let you go now that I got it
                    And all I need is to be struck
                    By your electric love
                    Baby, your electric love
                    Electric love

                    Drown me
                    You make my heart beat like the rain
                    Surround me
                    Hold me deep beneath your waves

                    And every night my mind is running around her
                    Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder

                    Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle

                    Rushing through me
                    Feel your energy rushing through me
                    Feel your energy rushing through me

        <muzzy:lyrics>Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
                    Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

                    When she was just a girl
                    She expected the world
                    But it flew away from her reach
                    So she ran away in her sleep

                    And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Every time she closed her eyes

                    Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
                    Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

                    When she was just a girl
                    She expected the world
                    But it flew away from her reach
                    And the bullets catch in her teeth

                    Life goes on, it gets so heavy
                    The wheel breaks the butterfly
                    Every tear, a waterfall
                    In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
                    In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

                    And dream of para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                    She'd dream of para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

                    La, la-la, la-la-la
                    La, la-la, la-la-la
                    La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
                    So lying underneath those stormy skies
                    She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise"

                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                    This could be para-, para-paradise
                    Para-, para-, paradise
                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    This could be para-, para-, paradise
                    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

                    Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
                    Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

        <rdfs:label>Beautiful Mistakes</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:lyrics>[Adam Levine:]
                    It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
                    You're like a broken home to me
                    I take a shot of memories
                    And black out like an empty street
                    I fill my days with the way you walk
                    And fill my nights with broken dreams
                    I make up lies inside my head
                    Like one day you'll come back to me

                    Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
                    I'm just depressed that you're gone
                    Not holding on, not holding on

                    Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
                    She's naked in my bed
                    And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
                    I wouldn't take 'em back
                    I'm in love with the past
                    And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

                    Nah-nah-nah, in my head
                    Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
                    Nah-nah-nah, eh
                    Making beautiful mistakes

                    It's pitiful, I can't believe
                    How every day gets worse for me
                    I take a break, I cut you off
                    To keep myself from looking soft
                    I fill my nights with the way you was
                    And still wake up with broken dreams
                    I make these lies inside my head
                    Feel like they're my reality

                    Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
                    I'm just depressed that you're gone
                    Not holding on, not holding on

                    Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
                    She's naked in my bed
                    And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
                    I wouldn't take 'em back
                    I'm in love with the past
                    And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

                    Nah-nah-nah, in my head
                    Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
                    Nah-nah-nah, eh eh
                    Making beautiful mistakes

                    [Megan Thee Stallion:]
                    You did me wrong 'cause I let you
                    Usually, I like my situations beneficial
                    Doing something different, got me looking stupid (Damn)

                    Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
                    Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
                    But really, I was doing just fine without ya
                    Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (Ah)
                    Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
                    Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
                    How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
                    You running outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

                    Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
                    Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (Hair)
                    Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
                    Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (Sad)
                    I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
                    Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
                    And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
                    You're toxic

                    Making beautiful mistakes
                    Nah-nah-nah, in my head
                    Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
                    Nah-nah-nah, eh
                    Making beautiful mistakes

                    Nah-nah-nah
                    Nah-nah-nah (Ooh)

        <muzzy:lyrics>[Zayn:]
                    Going out tonight
                    Changes into something red
                    Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
                    Everything she never had she's showing off

                    [Liam:]
                    Driving too fast
                    Moon is breaking through her hair
                    She's heading for something that she won't forget
                    Having no regrets is all that she really wants

                    [Harry:]
                    We're only getting older, baby
                    And I've been thinking about it lately
                    Does it ever drive you crazy
                    Just how fast the night changes?
                    Everything that you've ever dreamed of
                    Disappearing when you wake up
                    But there's nothing to be afraid of
                    Even when the night changes
                    It will never change me and you

                    [Louis:]
                    Chasing it tonight,
                    Doubts are running 'round her head
                    He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
                    Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

                    [Niall:]
                    Moving too fast
                    Moon is lighting up her skin
                    She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
                    Having no regrets is all that she really wants

                    [Harry:]
                    We're only getting older, baby
                    And I've been thinking about it lately
                    Does it ever drive you crazy
                    Just how fast the night changes?
                    Everything that you've ever dreamed of
                    Disappearing when you wake up
                    But there's nothing to be afraid of
                    Even when the night changes
                    It will never change me and you

                    Going out tonight
                    Changes into something red
                    Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
                    Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

                    [Harry (along all):]

                    Uncle is Gangnam style
                    Gangnam style

                    A girl who is warm and humanly during the day
                    A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee
                    A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes
                    A girl with that kind of twist

                    I'm a guy
                    A guy who is as warm as you during the day
                    A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down
                    A guy whose heart bursts when night comes
                    That kind of guy

                    Beautiful, loveable
                    Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
                    Beautiful, loveable

                    Eh sexy lady

                    A girl who looks quiet but plays when she plays
                    A girl who puts her hair down when the right time comes
                    A girl who covers herself but is more sexy than a girl who bares it all
                    A sensible girl like that

                    I'm a guy
                    A guy who seems calm but plays when he plays
                    A guy who goes completely crazy when the right time comes
                    A guy who has bulging ideas rather than muscles
                    That kind of guy

                    Beautiful, loveable
                    Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
                    Beautiful, loveable

                    Shoo-cha-choo-cha!

                    As he came into the window
                    Was a sound of a crescendo
                    He came into her apartment
                    He left the bloodstains on the carpet
                    She ran underneath the table
                    He could see she was unable
                    So she ran into the bedroom
                    She was struck down, it was her doom

                    Annie, are you OK?
                    So, Annie, are you OK?
                    Are you OK, Annie?

                    There's a sound at the window
                    Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
                    He came into your apartment
                    Left the bloodstains on the carpet
                    And then you ran into the bedroom
                    You were struck down
                    It was your doom

                    So they came into the outway
                    It was Sunday, what a black day
                    Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
                    Sounding heartbeats intimidations

                    Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
                    He came into your apartment
                    Left the bloodstains on the carpet
                    And then you ran into the bedroom
                    You were struck down
                    It was your doom

                    Annie, are you OK?
                    So, Annie, are you OK?
                    Are you OK, Annie?
                    You've been hit by—
                    You've been struck by a smooth criminal

                    Choo-cha, choo-cha

                    I don't know!
                    That he struck you a crescendo, Annie
                    I don't know!

                    He came into your apartment
                    I don't know!

                    I don't know why baby!
                    And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
                    You were struck down
                    It was your doom, Annie! (Dag gone it)

                    Annie, are you OK?
                    Dag gone it, baby!
                    Will you tell us, that you're OK

        <muzzy:lyrics>Balloons are deflated
                    Guess they look lifeless like me
                    We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
                    Still got your things here
                    And they stare at me like souvenirs
                    Don't wanna let you out my head

                    Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
                    Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
                    It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
                    Why you walk out my life?

                    I get like this every time
                    On these days that feel like you and me
                    Heartbreak anniversary
                    'Cause I remember every time
                    On these days that feel like you and me

                    (Ooh) No, no, no
                    (Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)

                    I'm buildin' my hopes up
                    Like presents unopened to this day
                    I still see the messages you read, mmm
                    I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
                    Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
                    Don't wanna let you out my head

                    Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
                    Said that you love me but that'll last for never
                    It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
                    Why you walk out my life? (My life)

                    I get like this every time

        <rdfs:label>Fly Me to the Moon</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:lyrics>"Fly Me to the Moon", originally titled "In Other Words", is a song written in 1954 by Bart 
            Howard. The first recording of the song was made in 1954 by Kaye Ballard. Frank Sinatra's 1964 version was 
            closely associated with the Apollo missions to the Moon. In 1999, the Songwriters Hall of Fame honored "Fly 
            Me to the Moon" by inducting it as a "Towering Song".</muzzy:lyrics>

        <muzzy:lyrics>Go ahead and bark after dark, fallen star
                    I'm your one-call away
                    Motel halls, neon walls
                    When night falls I am your escape
                    When you lay alone, I ache
                    Something I wanted to feel

                    If you've been waiting for falling in love
                    Babe, you don't have to wait on me
                    'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
                    But an angel ain't what I need

                    Not anyone, you're the one
                    More than fun, you're the sanctuary
                    'Cause what you want is what I want, sincerity

                    Souls that dream alone lie awake
                    I'll give you something so real

                    If you've been waiting for falling in love
                    Babe, you don't have to wait on me
                    'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
                    But an angel ain't what I need

                    Hold me oh so close, 'cause you never know
                    Just how long our lives will be

                    If you've been waiting for falling in love
                    Babe, you don't have to wait on me

                    You have me suicidal, suicidal
                    When you say it's over
                    Damn all these beautiful girls
                    They only wanna do you dirt
                    They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                    When they say it's over

                    See it started at the park
                    Used to chill after dark
                    Oh when you took my heart
                    That's when we fell apart
                    'Cause we both thought
                    That love last forever (last forever)
                    They say we're too young
                    To get ourselves sprung
                    Oh we didn't care
                    We made it very clear
                    And they also said
                    That we couldn't last together (last together)

                    See it's very defined
                    You're one of a kind
                    But you mash up my mind
                    You ought to get declined
                    Oh Lord
                    My baby is driving me crazy

                    You're way too beautiful girl
                    That's why it'll never work
                    You have me suicidal, suicidal
                    When you say it's over
                    Damn all these beautiful girls
                    They only wanna do you dirt
                    They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                    When they say it's over

                    It was back in '99
                    Watchin' movies all the time
                    Oh when I went away
                    For doin' my first crime
                    And I never thought
                    That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
                    And then I came out
                    Mami moved me down south
                    Oh I'm with my girl
                    Who I thought was my world
                    It came out to be
                    That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)

                    See it's very defined
                    You're one of a kind
                    But you mash up my mind
                    You have to get declined
                    Oh Lord
                    My baby is driving me crazy

                    You're way too beautiful girl
                    That's why it'll never work
                    You have me suicidal, suicidal
                    When you say it's over
                    Damn all these beautiful girls
                    They only wanna do you dirt
                    They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                    When they say it's over

                    Now we're fussin'
                    And now we're fightin'
                    Please tell me why
                    I'm feelin' slighted
                    And I don't know
                    How to make it better (make it better)
                    You're datin' other guys
                    You're tellin' me lies
                    Oh I can't believe
                    What I'm seein' with my eyes
                    I'm losin' my mind
                    And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)

                    You're way too beautiful, girl
                    That's why it'll never work
                    You have me suicidal, suicidal
                    When you say it's over
                    Damn, all these beautiful girls
                    They only wanna do you dirt
                    They'll have you suicidal, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal

        <muzzy:lyrics>You probably think that you are better now, better now
                    You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
                    You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
                    Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
                    You know I say that I am better now, better now
                    I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
                    You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
                    Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
                    Oh-oh

                    I did not believe that it would end, no
                    Everything came second to the Benzo
                    You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
                    You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
                    Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
                    We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
                    Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
                    Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
                    And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
                    With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
                    Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
                    But I can't get this shit outta my head

                    You probably think that you are better now, better now
                    You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

                    Oh-oh

                    I seen you with your other dude
                    He seemed like he was pretty cool
                    I was so broken over you
                    Life it goes on, what can you do?
                    I just wonder what it’s gonna take
                    Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
                    Because no matter how my life has changed
                    I keep on looking back on better days

                    You probably think that you are better now, better now

                    I promise
                    I swear to you, I'll be okay
                    You're only the love of my life (love of my life)

        <muzzy:lyrics>He takes you out and he takes you up
                    'cause he can show you so much
                    I go to bed and tomorrow again
                    there's a lot of work to be done

                    He gives you gold and he'll promise you
                    the whole world will be yours
                    I just can tell you I love you so
                    even though my odds are low

                    [Chorus:]
                    I'm not an actor I'm not a star
                    and I don't even have my own car
                    But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
                    that you will love me anyway

                    The dirty games and the neonshows
                    this is the world he knows
                    Watching the stars satisfies my soul
                    thinking of him makes me feel so cold

                    The fancy cars and the restaurants
                    you're just so fond of the man
                    Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
                    can't you see, he's got dirt on his mind

                    [Chorus:]
                    I'm not an actor I'm not a star
                    and I don't even have my own car...

        <rdfs:label>Story of My Life</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:lyrics>Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
                    I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
                    She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
                    It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

                    And I'll be gone, gone tonight
                    The ground beneath my feet is open wide
                    The way that I been holding on too tight
                    With nothing in between

                    The story of my life
                    I take her home
                    I drive all night
                    To keep her warm
                    And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
                    The story of my life
                    I give her hope
                    I spend her love
                    Until she's broke
                    Inside
                    The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

                    Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
                    Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
                    I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
                    Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

                    And I'll be gone, gone tonight
                    The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
                    The way that I've been holding on so tight
                    With nothing in between

                    The story of my life
                    I take her home
                    I drive all night
                    To keep her warm
                    And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
                    The story of my life
                    I give her hope
                    I spend her love
                    Until she's broke
                    Inside
                    The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

                    And I been waiting for this time to come around
                    But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

                    The story of my life
                    I take her home
                    I drive all night
                    To keep her warm
                    And time is frozen
                    The story of my life
                    I give her hope (give her hope)
                    I spend her love
                    Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
                    Inside
                    The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

                    The story of my life
                    The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
                    The story of my life

        <muzzy:lyrics>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
                    Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
                    You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
                    Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
                    You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

                    Killing me slow, out the window
                    I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
                    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
                    What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

                    And it's new, the shape of your body
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got
                    And it's ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                    No rules in breakable heaven
                    But ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    With you

                    Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
                    I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
                    We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
                    We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

                    So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
                    I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
                    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
                    And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

                    Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got
                    And it's ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                    No rules in breakable heaven
                    But ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    With you

                    I'm drunk in the back of the car
                    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
                    Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
                    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
                    And I snuck in through the garden gate
                    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
                    And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
                    I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
                    He looks up, grinning like a devil

                    It's new, the shape of your body
                    It's blue, the feeling I've got
                    And it's ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                    No rules in breakable heaven
                    But ooh, whoa oh
                    It's a cruel summer
                    With you

                    I'm drunk in the back of the car
                    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
                    Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
                    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
                    And I snuck in through the garden gate
                    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
                    And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
                    I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
                    (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
