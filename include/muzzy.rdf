        <rdfs:label>Still Into You</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:abstract>Still Into You is a song by American rock band Paramore. 
            It was released on March 14, 2013, as the second single from their self-titled fourth studio album, Paramore. 
            Recorded in 2012 in Los Angeles, California, Still Into You is a departure from the sound of
            their previous single, Now, and incorporates a lighter pop rock sound, while being described 
            as sweet and sugary. The song received acclaim from music critics, who have praised
            the song and Hayley Williams vocals as catchy and strong and effective, as well as deeming it as 
            one of the songs of the summer of 2013. It is among their most commercially 
            successful singles in the United States, becoming a top-ten hit on the Mainstream Top 40, ranking at 
            number eight on Billboard, Hot Rock Songs, and receiving double-platinum certification in the 
            United States.</muzzy:abstract>

        <rdfs:label>Don't Panic</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:abstract>Don't Panic is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. 
            Originally titled Panic, the earliest known version of the song existed in 1998, performed 
            live during the bands first gig in the same year. It had a different melody, and was included in 
            the bands third EP, The Blue Room. The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson 
            for the bands debut album, Parachutes. Following their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their 
            record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the 
            decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles 
            Yellow and Trouble. They settled on Don't Panic, which at the time 
            was an audience favourite. It was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received 
            a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive.</muzzy:abstract>

        <rdfs:label>Smooth Criminal</rdfs:label>
        <muzzy:abstract>Smooth Criminal is a song by the American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 14, 1988, 
            as the seventh single from his seventh album, Bad (1987). It was written by Jackson and produced by 
            Jackson and Quincy Jones. The lyrics address a woman who has been attacked in her apartment by a 
            smooth criminal. The refrain Annie, are you OK? was inspired by Resusci Anne, 
            a dummy used in CPR training. The music video for Smooth Criminal, which premiered on MTV on 
            October 13, 1988, is the centerpiece of the 1988 film Moonwalker. The 1930s setting and Jackson's 
            white suit and fedora pay tribute to the Fred Astaire musical comedy film *The Band Wagon*. In the video, 
            Jackson and the dancers perform an apparently physically impossible anti-gravity lean. 
            Smooth Criminal reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the sixth top-10 single 
            from Bad. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart. It was certified double platinum 
            by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song reached number one in Belgium, Iceland, 
            the Netherlands, and Spain. Retrospective reviews have described it as one of Jackson's best songs. 
            Rolling Stone wrote that it was his best blend of R &amp; B groove and rock edginess, and a turning 
            point in his shift toward darker, harder-edged material. It has appeared on numerous greatest hits 
            albums and was performed on all of Jackson's solo tours. Smooth Criminal was re-released in 
            2006 as a single as a part of Jackson's Visionary: The Video Singles boxset.</muzzy:abstract>
